title: Searching through clutter
---

When you look for something specific in a busy scene - like finding your friend in a crowd or spotting your keys on a cluttered table -, your brain and eyes work together to scan the area, picking out details that help you find what you're looking for. In this project, I analyzed eye movement patterns to investigate what aspects of a visual scene guide our attention (is it color? shape? size?).
