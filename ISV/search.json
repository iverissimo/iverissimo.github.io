    "text": "In this project I wanted to examine how the brain integrates information from different senses, like sight and touch. Using advanced MRI techniques, image processing and machine learning models, I created detailed maps of how the brain organizes visual and body-related information. Curious on how it looks?

    "section": "",
    "text": "When you look for something specific in a busy scene - like finding your friend in a crowd or spotting your keys on a cluttered table -, your brain and eyes work together to scan the area, picking out details that help you find what you’re looking for. In this project, I analyzed eye movement patterns to investigate what aspects of a visual scene guide our attention (is it color? shape? size?).\nWant to know more about this topic? You can find the peer-reviewed publications here or here.\nThis work was presented at the European Conference on Visual Perception 2023 Edition, in Paphos, Cyprus."
