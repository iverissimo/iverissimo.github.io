    "text": "In most visual neuroscience experiments, researchers display visual stimuli - like expanding circles or rotating checkerboards — while participants lie in an MRI scanner. By tracking which areas of the visual cortex light up in response to these patterns, we can map out how different regions of the brain correspond to specific parts of our visual field.\n\n\n\n\nDesigning these experiments requires fine-tuning the types of stimuli to be used, their timing, and repetition to get clean, reliable data that’s easy to interpret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurious to see how an experimental stimulus code works? Check out my project repository! In this project, I designed a new mapping protocol to explore how attention shapes the brain’s processing of visual information."

    "text": "In this project I wanted to examine how the brain integrates information from different senses, like sight and touch. Using advanced MRI techniques, image processing and machine learning models, I created detailed maps of how the brain organizes visual and body-related information.\n\n\n\n\nCurious on how it looks?

    "section": "",
    "text": "When you look for something specific in a busy scene - like finding your friend in a crowd or spotting your keys on a cluttered table -, your brain and eyes work together to scan the area, picking out details that help you find what you’re looking for. In this project, I analyzed eye movement patterns to investigate what aspects of a visual scene guide our attention (is it color? shape? size?).\nWant to know more about this topic?
